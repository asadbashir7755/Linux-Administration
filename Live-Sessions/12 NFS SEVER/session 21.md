## üìù Notes

- **NFS Server:** Shares directories by configuring `/etc/exports` and starting `nfs-server`.
- **NFS Client:** Mounts shared directories using `mount -t nfs ...`.
- Use `showmount -e <server>` to view available exports.
- For persistent mounts, add entries to `/etc/fstab` and use `mount -a`.
- Ownership and permissions are important for access.
- Use `systemctl` to manage NFS server status.
