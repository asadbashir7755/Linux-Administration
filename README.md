# üñ•Ô∏è Linux System Administration

This repository contains my notes, commands, and examples from my **Linux System Administration** learning journey.  
All sessions are stored in the `sessions` folder, each with its own `README.md` file.

Commands are written in fenced `bash` code blocks so they are easy to copy.
