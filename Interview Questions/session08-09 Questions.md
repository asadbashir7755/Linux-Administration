### ðŸ”¹ Repository & EPEL

1. Why do we use the EPEL repository in CentOS/RHEL systems?

### ðŸ”¹ Connectivity & Troubleshooting

6. How would you confirm network connectivity before running `dnf install`?
7. Why is `ping google.com` preferred over `ping 8.8.8.8` when testing DNS resolution?

9. Whatâ€™s the purpose of editing `.repo` files inside `/etc/yum.repos.d/`?
10. Why is it risky to disable base repos in CentOS?

### ðŸ”¹ Package Management & Installed Packages

11. How do you list all installed packages in your system?
12. Why would you redirect installed package output to a file (`dnf list installed > total_pkgs`)?
13. How do you count the number of installed packages quickly?
14. Whatâ€™s the significance of `.noarch` in package names like `words.noarch` or `epel-release.noarch`?
15. How would you verify if a specific package (e.g., `nload`) is installed?

### ðŸ”¹ Installation & Verification

16. Whatâ€™s the difference between `dnf search nload` and `dnf info nload`?
17. Why would you use `dnf install epel-release.noarch` before searching for certain packages?
18. What does `dnf list installed | grep nload` return if the package is not present?
19. What is the purpose of `dnf install -y` compared to `dnf install` without `-y`?
20. How do you differentiate between dependencies installed with a package vs. manually installed ones?

### ðŸ”¹ Repo & File Management

21. Whatâ€™s the difference between absolute and relative paths when listing repo files? (`ls /etc/yum.repos.d/` vs `ls yum.repos.d`)
22. Why is it recommended to use `pwd` before running relative path commands?
23. What information do you get from `ls -l /etc/yum.repos.d/` compared to a simple `ls`?
24. If a repo file is corrupted, how can you recover or re-enable it?
25. Why might you need to add third-party repos manually?

### ðŸ”¹ System & History

26. How does `history` help in troubleshooting package installation issues?
