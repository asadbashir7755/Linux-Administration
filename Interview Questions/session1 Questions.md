16. You typed a very long command yesterday and want to find it again. Which command would you use?
17. How do you rerun the last command from history without retyping it?

24. What is the difference between ls -a and ls -A?
25. If you want to view file sizes in KB/MB/GB format, which option will you use?
26. A user wants to see files in reverse order of modification time. Which command will achieve this?
27. How can you view directory contents sorted in ‚Äúnatural‚Äù numeric order (e.g., file1, file2 ‚Ä¶ file10)?
28. Your server has hundreds of log files. How can you display only the last 10 files sorted by time?
29. How do you distinguish between a file, directory, and symbolic link in ls -l output?
